## General Info
Like so many projects before, this project is written to facilitate the creation of other projects. I decided not to use an array as the basic container for the data to be held in the Tree. As JavaScript/Typescript is so object-centric these days, especially since es6, I decided to create an array-like object with an iterator and implement a Tree using that as the data container.

## Technologies Used
Only plain, vanilla Typescript is used with no libraries or other packages.

## Features

## Setup
Simply import the *YATree* class into the project in the usual way. We must also, at a minimum, import the *Node* class from *NodeCollection* dependency project.

## Usage

## Project Status
As this code is intended to be a part of a project in itself, this project is still in progress and will be until that project is completed. 
 
## Room for Improvement
The areas where there may be some room for improvement are those where some properties may be better suited to be public and thereby a couple functions should be removed.
